    "text": "I think this linked gold dog collar is darling! It is surprisingly lightweight (which leads some people to think it’s plastic at first), but I can assure you that it clinks like metal, and it feels cold at room temperature, just like typical stainless steel appliances do. It lays flat against the neck, self-adjusts smoothly through the “O” ring, and feels quite sturdy, especially for small/medium-sized dogs that don’t aggressively pull. I have a 20-lb chiweenie, and if she wears this chain fully relaxed, it’s a little too big and hangs down around her shoulders, but for heavier dogs or breeds with thicker necks, it would be perfect. This product would also be great for giving photo shoots an extra bit of bling!",

If you are hoping for a more pronounced flavor, these won't provide it. But they do have a nice, gentle flavor. There aren't many in a bag yet I can't eat many at once (despite having a huge appetite)--they are rather filling. The crackers are thin but dense. I can eat them plain or pair them with a soft cheese or hummus. They stand up well to dips. They have a snap, but are easy on the teeth. Can mash into the tops of teeth, so plan to pick some cracker out. They remind me of a thicker wheat thins (but ya know, gluten free). Pretty good overall.<br /><br />My order was for a pack of six, and I received one box. Hopefully your order will be filled correctly. Better value with the multi pack.",

I have had fake plants before and they really looked fake so was a bit dubious about ordering these at first but now I am so glad I did. Everyone that comes to the door thinks they are real and ask me what kind of plant they are. They have a waxy coating on them which has been great during the wet weather. Only time will tell how fade resistant they are but they are more for fall decoration and so won't be out much past November.<br /><br />Great price and amazing quality. Highly recommend!",

Hair feels soft and when I run my hand thru it I don't see any shedding and it doesn't smell funny. But if you're looking for thickness and length I would look elsewhere. They did ship super fast.

I don't often get out somewhere that carries this treat, so I am glad I found it here. Smooth, chewy, soft outer with small glob of lychee flavored gel. I could use more lychee flavor, or more of the center substance. No visual texture like some of the customer pics. Smooth like the product pics.<br /><br />Sweet, high calories. It does provide a sense of fullness. It sits kind of heavy. I am a big eater, and I would not eat more than one. Pretty typical of mochi, and so if I were looking to buy more I would likely get this again. Who knows.",

The 365 brand is $2.99 almost twice as big and 20 calories less. This is my ignorance for not reading the reviews and not reading the ounces. At this point i rather just buy the powder and make it myself. I definitely plan to rage eat these while sulking.",

Here is the ingredient list:<br /><br />garlic, salt, spices, tricalcium phosphate (prevents caking).<br /><br />The sea salt is in larger flakes. It has a subtle salty taste. I am so used to the fine salt mixed with garlic, that it is a rarely used item. Since acquiring this blend, it has been used several times. It is delicious to use on just about anything you want lightly salty tasting garlic flavoring on.<br /><br />It IS great on everything. I also highly recommend their Garlic & Pepper spice mix- great flavor!",

If you break it up, it will kind of grow in volume. It is plenty for dumping over a salad, or for making a sandwich, a quick soup, or adding to a pasta dish. A quicky favorite of mine is to add mayo to drained chicken, finely cut up some vegetables, mix all together then eat with crackers.<br /><br />There is water. Reserve for use in making gravy, or making/adding to soup. Or just drain it.<br /><br />I like it more than anticipated. It didnt really have any of that canned/tinned taste that some chicken has, Nor was it swimming in blobs of fat. I didnt know that this is a BumbleBee brand.

Wowza, my mouth was on fire! BUT, the taste was so natural, fresh, and delicious that I figured it would be amazing sprinkled on finished food, or as part of the seasoning while food is cooking. Accurate! I have used it on eggs and potatoes.

It’s always risky ordering jewelry sight unseen, but this turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The hashtag has little crystals on it. The BFF is sturdy and solid. It doesn’t bend or flex when pressure is applied. The chain is mid-range, but perfect for a teen. It doesn’t look like it’s going to break easily at all. This is definitely something that my daughter is proud to give as a gift. Overall it’s a nice quality, whimsical piece of jewelry and much nicer than we expected.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.",

The design is vertical so she puts it on her bed that way so the design can be seen. The case is soft and silky. It kind of feels like a faux satin material. The images are bright and clear. She loves this addition to her bed! **6/23/16 - I ordered another Twenty One Pilot pillow case of a different design. These cases are made very well.

Prior to using this, my daughter was keeping all of her colored pencils in a shoe box. All of her pencils are in view at the same time so she doesn't have to dig through all of them to find the color she is looking for. It does get rather bulky when rolled up.

Also, those on a high protein diet will appreciate the higher protein content.<br /><br />I don't think these taste anything like tortilla chips. They were more like eating crunchy cardboard that tastes a little on the stale side. I was going to throw them away but it turns out my husband likes them enough that he will try to finish them.<br /><br />Not only are these not great tasting, but the package is small and more like what you would see in a two serving bag so not really a great value for what you get.<br /><br />I don't like giving negative reviews but I just couldn't find anything about the taste that I could spin into a positive. This is a hard pass for me.",

The resulting brew was cloudy yellow/green and the flavor was all vegetal and slightly sweet. I actually feel like I am drinking something very healthy when drinking this. I also love that this comes from Japan instead of China.<br /><br />Note that the only English words or instructions on the package are a label that is slapped on in the back. The ingredients are green tea--specifically high grade crude green tea. Note that gokuzyo means highest grade and aracha means crude or rough tea, so this is gokuzyo aracha.<br /><br />In summary, I really like this tea. At $39 for 100 tea bags, it comes to a reasonable $.39 cents per cup.",

These bars are from the coffee collection and they have a subtle hint of the aftertaste you get when you eat a chocolate covered coffee bean. The bars have a soft texture that is easy to chew, and they have a pleasant taste without being overly sweet. This is a perfect mid-workout bar because they are easy on the stomach and provide plenty of fuel. These are some of the best tasting energy bars available and are perfect for coffee lovers.",

Problem 2: on the other unit, the fabric was so tight- I almost broke all the tubing where the Velcro wraps over it. I stretched the fabric for all it was worth to get even a little Velcro to grab. You’ll see the bowing in one pic. These things must be slapped together where made, with little regard for quality or accuracy. Disappointed, and I doubt this will last.

Everyone that comes to the door thinks they are real and ask me what kind of plant they are. They have a waxy coating on them which has been great during the wet weather. Only time will tell how fade resistant they are but they are more for fall decoration and so won't be out much past November.<br /><br />Great price and amazing quality. Highly recommend!",

There is a bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo).

Maybe if you have colored BLACK (1B)hair you could get a match but it still looks ridiculous.<br />In the Photos I was able to make it look somewhat presentable by adding a reddish hair piece to make it look like a formal updo.

I knew the moment I peered into the bag of black, shiny, oily, whole beans that I was in for a treat. Smell is absolutely divine, too. I ground some up and made it in my pour over (one of these days I will use in my drip maker). Mmm so good. Smooth, zero acidity, zero bitter. Definitely dark. I drink my coffee black, and this is just so delicious to me.<br /><br />If you like dark roasts, give this a whirl. I imagine it would hold up well over ice. I wont waste it on cold brew (I tend to use cheap coffee that i dont love for cold brew because cold brewing makes nearly any coffee taste good). But yeh, this would likely be extra amazing.",

The open design is comfortable and doesn't cause her hands to get too hot while practicing. Her usual cloves cover her entire palm/hand and are basically just fingerless. I ordered the small size for her and they fit her well. The padding on the palms could be a little thicker, but it is adequate.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",

When I received the delivery it was a medium-large box, cool to the touch..so I figured it had ice in it. I opened it to find the smallest, little, tiny box of chocolate covered cake the size of dimes I guess..cause there are 12 in this box!!! OMG I’m just embarrassed to give it to my sister as a gift!! I rated it a 2 Star Overall: 5 Star on Flavor because it’s Godiva (though I haven’t opened it, it’s a gift), 2 Star on Giftable because it’s such a tiny tinny box, and 1 Star for Value For Money! Thank God I’m giving her another gift also!! Hope this helps someone!!",

She especially liked that they came in a color other than white! I got to try them out, too. I don't usually wear earbuds because I find them uncomfortable, but these didn't bother me. I guess I am a fan of the Apple style earbuds, too. The sound quality is decent and on par with other earbuds, but not as good as some over the ear style headphones. There is no distortion or static. You can adjust the volume on the cable. My daughter is very happy with these, but I'll stick with my over the ear style headphones.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

Also there are no lines or cuffs in the gloves as advertised. You can see the tone of your skin when you put on they are so thin. Not sure how this seller is even allowed to sell this to people. Better get refund or I will be reporting to the better business bureau. Shameful to take people's money and falsely advertise.",

I bought this mainly to cover my greys in between my hair dyes. This did not cover my grey hair at all and what makes it worst, it is very watery so it runs when I apply it to my hair.

To adjust, I just pushed in the pop-out button and adjusted it to my desired height (about hip bone area). This is rated for up to 300 pounds and it feels sturdy enough for that weight. The handle is comfortable and the cane is balanced well. There's a small wrist holder on the cane handle but that is nothing special. There is some play in the handle but that is to be expected as a result of its adjustability.<br /><br />The price of $24.99 is reasonable for this.

    "text": "This is a nice sized pan, and is sturdy, however, there is a rolled edge that is too tight to dry with a towel, so any water that gets under there during washing, stays there until it can air dry and then immediately rusts. Once the rusty areas air dry, the rust flakes off in large pieces on my counter and in the cupboard. I hand wash (with a soft hemp and cotton dish rag) and towel dry this pan. Also the coating on the inside is flaking off, exposing bare metal which is now also rusting. It also stains easily, as I used this pan for holding hot water for bread proofing in my oven, and yet the there is a water stain around the sides that wont come off even with washing. I would appreciate a refund for this pan, but it doesn't appear that the seller offers any kind of warranty, nor stands behind their product.",

I got the bundle deal for 2x16” and 1 18”. The pictures show one of the 16” bundles that you can see are not only thin on the ends but stretched only is about 13” IF you can give it that",

In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the puff is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.<br /><br />In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. The current price of $6.99 is a little high for this as I can buy something like this at my local Walmart for about $2 less.",

The predominant flavor is vinegar but it is not offensive. I personally hate vinegar and loved these. The current price of $23.99 comes to $.96 cents per serving.

Ended up putting it away and using my old trusty Coleman tent. I’m 6’5” and this thing is not comfortable for a guy built like a real man like me. Can’t imagine 2 people in it at the same time. I’d pass on this tent hammock and just go with what is tried and true. Air mattress and a normal tent.",

Also, it has a nice lather. My hair came out nice with this shampoo and I have short to medium fine curly hair.<br /><br />One thing I hate is that the package had hardly any English writing on it where it matters (see photos). Everything is pretty much in Korean. Also, I cannot attest to its ability to stop hair loss. There is still enough of my hair that I catch in the drain.<br /><br />The current price of $35.90 is pricey for 500ml (16.907 fluid ounces) but then this is like a salon-style shampoo to me. I just wish the floral scent was more intense. BTW, the bottle with shampoo looks beautiful to me; I love the presentation.",

Not great pictures either. Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it. If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is. That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes. Make NO mistake, these are SHARP. Use them delicately and only on smooth skin. If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off. You will bleed.

However, I doubt anyone is skinny enough to be able to use all those adjustments. I had to use it on the longest length. The long bar has a 20\" chain but extends an additional 4.5\" with the extra piece hanging at the end. This chain is adjustable to five lengths. Both necklaces can be worn at once or separately. The long bar looks great on a solid colored turtleneck. The small necklace looks great just on a bare neck with almost any blouse as it sits right at the throat.<br /><br />I think the current price of $19.99 is competitive for this. Be aware that the chains are thin and are easily knotted. Care has to be taken when storing and wearing. This is definitely a very attractive but delicate adjustable necklace set.",

This is so small it wouldn’t even work for my cats. Also I received 3 filters total not three extra. If you look at the picture I submitted here this should not even be called a fountain. What fountain? And it says three water flow settings there are only two. Ok I wasn't even thinking about what makes the water flow. Can you say electrical shock? The wire that plugs into the wall is actually in the water. One little tear in that and your finished. Also the actual spot they drink from is almost a flat surface. It did come with a cute rubber matt but it's so tiny that I couldn't use it for anything anyway. I have to say that this product was an epic fail, buyer beware!",

The first night she packed it (not overpacked by any means), a rip about 1.5 inches appeared on the lower left edge on the seam. She is leaving in a few days so we don't have time to get a new one. We cannot even properly sew it because it's lined. On a positive note, we loved the color and look of it. I wish we had time to have a new one shipped.",

So the boxes are completely ruined and you have to rip and cut just to get to the kcups. Also, the Best by date on the Barista Prima boxes read Dec 19 2021 (we received Nov 20, 2021) However there is a sticker on the outside of the taped box tower that has been placed on by seller possibly that says Best by 08/10/2022.",

This provides stronger support.<br /><br />This is very comfortable to wear as well and provides me with moderate support for the lumbar region. The current price of $21.99 ($23.99 minus $2) is very reasonable for this. The only negative is that no instructions are provided.

They taste good and have a soft chew. They are cute flowers. Each little 2.82oz bag is supposed to be 2 servings, 11 chews per serving approx. Most will eat the whole bag and be a quick 200 calories and 66 g carbohydrates. My other issue, may be petty to some, is quality control. My bag only had 1 red flowe so it was a bag of yellow, greenish gummies. These may be vegan, but far from healthy.",

Each slice looks just like a regular banana slice but is lighter and a bit puffy. They're nice and soft and easy to chew. I have some fillings, crowns and 2 dental implants and have no issue chewing them or getting stuck to my dental work. Of course, they taste like banana but not quite as strong. There is a sweetness to them.<br /><br />Banana Bites are perfect to snack on, great to take along when on the go, make a good snack during extra curricular activities. They dont' make a mess; heck, they don't even make fingers sticky. I do think the price is a tad on the high side but I'd still purchase again thanks to the good taste and convenience. I plan on trying the banana/strawberry flavor next.",

Every single one of my chocolates (and I love the taste and quality of Dove products) was complete liquid! As soon as I took them out of the shipping box I threw the whole box in the refrigerator! I doubt they will chill to the original form so my plan is to melt them down in my fondue pot and serve the chocolate with fresh fruits for a delicious dessert! So if you plan on ordering these... Beware they may arrive completely melted!",

The mesh band is very slim and lightweight. The watch display dial part is of medium thickness. (Not slim). Watch in total weighs 3.2 ounces which is pretty lightweight. Overall, it has a beautiful large face and looks fabulous. However, battery died after 2 months and had to have it replaced for $10. Less one star on review. Second purchase of this watch the battery lasted only 8 months. Look like this company is using cheap or outdated batteries.<br />If you find this review helpful, kindly vote below so I can improve future reviews as well.",

I washed it on a delicate cycle 3 times, and the smell diminished. I was surprised by how much lint ended up in my washing machine, but even more surprised by what came off of it after drying on the lowest heat setting. It filled my lint trap 3 times before I decided to take it out and shake it. No matter how much I shook, it never stopped shedding. This is also when I noticed it was see through, had many pulls, and the stitching around the edge was coming undone in several places. I will be returning this piece of garbage. It feels like someone pressed some dryer lint together and called it a blanket. This company should be ashamed of themselves.",

The shirt itself was also too big for it being a US Medium. If you want to give this tank a try go 1 size smaller. It would be useful for the seller to post the model’s weight and height plus size he is wearing to gauge how big these run. I am not as buff as the model but I do have a slim athletic build.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to my wife and it looks better on her due to that ridiculously large neck. I posted pictures of me wearing this tank. I am 165lbs 6ft tall.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.

You can see the pixels from very far away and the ironed on image is very shiny. Not professionally done at all. Plus the item is shipped from China so when I went to mail it back the shipping cost would have been over $40 just to get the $30 back that the item cost.

I had to remove the inner seal, reseat the cap, open the top, turn over, and grind the amount desired onto my food. Note that the cap is sort of two separate pieces in the sense that the lower flat end is what gets secured onto the rim and tightened tight. The top round end turns forever. Therefore, when seating the cap onto the jar, make sure to hold only the lower collar on the cap to tighten. I did not do that originally and I was turning forever.<br /><br />The ingredients are 91% sea salt and 9% African habanero chili.

The card enclosed recommends 8-10 hours in the full sun (I live on the Oregon Coast - rare to have that much sun these days) OR toss in dryer on low setting for 45 mins to help dissipate the odor - I did the dryer option. I don't think it made much of an impact on the odor but is definitely fluffed them quickly. In my experience the memory foam odor does eventually dissipate. They are firmer. I am a side/stomach sleeper and they seem a bit too firm for my personal taste - but I actually purchased them for the sham pillows (really just for looks) - so they work well for me. They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great condition along with other items I ordered. Having said all that - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",

No extreme exposure to sun (as you can see in photo the discoloration isnt uniform, its random and blotchy) hasnt gotten wet and I haven't washed it. As you can tell the hat hasnt been abused. Which just leads me to believe I either bought a KNOCK-OFF or the hat is severely defective.<br /><br />Never had a hat fade like this before after 2 months and minimal wear. Now it's nothing better than a hat to wear while working in the yard. Either that or throw it out. If I could return it I would but sadly now it's basically garbage. If I could give the hat zero stars I would.",

You have to jiggle it around like a puzzle to get one. I mostly blame myself, but come on! Complete waste of money. The only, ONLY salvaging factor is the cut out ninja turtles on the back that can be cut out into ornaments. So if you want to purchase this, this is what you’ll be getting - 24pcs of poor quality Chocolate, and 3 cardboards ornaments. I’ll let you decide if it’s worth it.",

IMO, the teal-ish colored stripe is closer to light and darker variations of a royal blue, which still adds that pop of color, but it’s definitely not navy. I actually bought navy sheets with it after reading other reviews about the color and had to exchange them for gray because navy did NOT match. The plaid fabric is a little stiff but seems durable. My biggest complaint is that the solid gray back looks a little peachy tie-dye discolored after 1 wash using Clorox2 for colors, so I definitely don’t recommend using that product on it. Overall, for what I paid, and the fact that the back is hidden, it’s good.",

The ingredients are ginger, turmeric, licorice root, lemon bits, galangal, natural flavors, and black peppers.<br /><br />It comes in a 2.5 ounce package that supposedly makes about 20 to 25 cups of tea. I like the tab to open and the lock strip to close. I used one teaspoon per one cup of water even though 15 was recommended. I steeped it for 5 minutes at 208 degrees as specified. The brew is a very pale yellow. The predominant taste is tumeric and only a hint of ginger even though that is the first ingredient. I personally feel it is a very good tisane and so does my boyfriend. We both rate it 4 stars.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is reasonable.",

I took them to a professional to have them put in and we had to remove ALL of the tape and use her salon tape because they didn't stick AT ALL!

    "text": "This poop bag holder is unique in that the side rolls away to insert the poop bag then rolls back and snaps shut. It is a bit awkward to thread the bags through the hole. There is also one roll of bags included. I assume the roll contains 15 bags as that is typical. There is also a lanyard for carrying.<br /><br />The holder dispenses the bags easily and is easy to reload. The most difficult part is threading the bags through the hole since the holder is plastic and has no \"give\" to grab the start of the bag. In a standard holder, I can thread the bag through before I close the holder but that is not possible with this one. The hole is not accessible until the unit is closed.<br /><br />Overall, this is attractive and functional The current price of $8.99 is competitively priced for this.",

Since it is a fine powder the holes on the sprinkle side might make too much come out. I may see if I have a small shaker jar to put this in. THEN I will find it easier to sprinkle on pizza, pasta, popcorn, etc.<br /><br />Pack of two is going to last me a long time, so you may want to share a bottle with someone. I acquird this 02/2022, with a best by date of 12/2024",

It's irritating that it would be such a hassle to get a replacement because I'm an hour from the closest Amazon return store so its a 2hr round trip.<br /><br />Update: Ordered a 2nd one because my boyfriend liked it and said it was the perfect size for him and he really wanted one so I went ahead and ordered another. His did not have printing issues but it did have a thin faulty spot. Instead of being on the bottom it was near the top. THIS THING HOLD ONTO DIRT LIKE NO OTHER.

I got a 3xl thinking that some people have said they run small but this is crazy small. The price is right but \"the size wrong\"",

I had succeeded, but several big life events sent me back into the arms of cookies and candies.<br /><br />I am also careful with which artificial sweeteners I use. Note this is not a debate about whether to use artificial sweeteners...some folks need them.<br /><br />I am allergic to aspartame. I have found sucralose, while not being the best one for you, tastes the closest to real sugar to me. However, monk fruit is what the sweetener is in a few of my favorite sugar-free foods. Gotta say, it isn't my first choice, because I find the texture to be less-than-desireable...it can be a little gritty.<br />But I am determined to learn to substitute monk fruit for real sugar in recipes. It will be a learning curve, but this bag has enough to experiment with fairly easily.",
